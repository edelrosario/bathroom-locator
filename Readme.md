# Bathroom Locator

Project for CAP 3032 ||
Author : Elaine Del Rosario

## Changes Since Iteration 3
- Altered colors for back button and background
- Added a background image to make less plain
- Added an Icon class to visually display the amount of stalls in the bathroom
- Changed text fonts and sizes
- There is a Flush class for a sound effect when the user clicked the back button (currently not functional)

## Critical Analysis

### 1. Visceral
The overall project itself is very clean.  The screen is not very distracting, and the code runs perfectly fine.  The user is able to see what exactly it is they want to see; nothing is too cluttered on screen.  It may not appear to be the most appealing program, but it has a basic foundation that can be easily built upon to make it more like a usable application.

### 2. Behavioral
The user is able to point and click on any button of his or her choosing.  The buttons will take the user to the corresponding building/floor they wish to locate bathrooms for.  The application is very simple and easy to use; the user can easily navigate back and forth through panels.  On the outside it is professionally developed; the coding framework, however, needs a little more work.  For the most part, the code is very object-oriented.

### 3. Reflective
Besides the fact that Processing does not have a user locator/gps library, the Bathroom Locator I feel like definitely has value.  It gives the user directions that are very general and easy to follow.  It may not be the most visual compelling, but that can always be easily edited and changed.  If Processing had a working gps-type library, it could definitely be something people would pay for, albeit not for a high price.

## Self-Reflection

### What is your favorite Processing method and why?
My favorite method in processing was drawing the shapes to the screen.  With the shapes, I was able to do hover detection and have fun altering the colors if I wanted to.  Shapes are very versatile with what they can do, such as detection, borders, and button creation.  There are plenty more functions for shapes, but there are the main ones that carried most of my project.

### What difficulties did you have throughout the iterative development process?
I first started out having problems making my program object-oriented and thinking in an object-oriented manner.  My code was all over the place, or jammed into one class that should have been separated in to two others. I also had problems figuring out how to store my content information.  I could manually add panels to the panelManager() constructor, but that eventually takes up a lot of memory and storage.  If I had more time, I would have fleshed out a better code involving my .csv files.  I also had problems getting my sound effect to work when clicking on the back button, but that is something more minor and a fun side effect.

### What is the most valuable thing you learned in this course?
This course definitely helped me start thinking in a more object-oriented manner.  My future classes will no doubt have me required thinking in such a way, so this was a great start for me.  I’m still a little rusty with it, but I’m much better than when I first started the class.

### Will you approach your next project differently based on your experience? In what way?
Definitely.  I will probably start by thinking of basic classes that I can start off with, and then slowly build on it as my program/code gets bigger and more complex.  Then, when I see certain parts of code relate to another, I can create a new class for it.
